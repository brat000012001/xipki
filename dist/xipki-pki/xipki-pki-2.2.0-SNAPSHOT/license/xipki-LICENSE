THE XiPKI SOFTWARE IS AVAILABLE UNDER TWO LICENSING MODELS:

============ COMMERCIAL LICENSING ============

A XiPKI commercial license provides advantages not available with the
open-source AGPL license. Specific benefits include:
Release from the requirements of the copyleft AGPL license, which include:
1. distribution of all source code, including your own product (even for
   web-based applications)
2. licensing of your own product under the AGPL license
3. prominent mention and inclusion of the XiPKI copyright and the AGPL license

============ THE AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (AGPL) ============

While the AGPL license has no direct financial cost there are clear requirements
for AGPL use. Buying a commercial license is mandatory as soon as you develop
activities involving the XiPKI software without disclosing the source code of
your own applications.
